## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning, often used as an introductory dataset for classification algorithms. The goal of this project was to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*, based on features such as petal and sepal lengths and widths.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples, each with the following attributes:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target label)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: for data processing and model building.
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: for machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: for data visualization.
